## Settings for ejabberd

## Where should ejabberd find its configuration file?
#
CONFIG_FILE=/etc/ejabberd/ejabberd-xs.cfg

## ULIMIT_MAX_FILES alters the number of files that ejabberd is
## allowed to have open at once.  If it is unset the system default
## (usually 1024) will be used.  ejabberd will want over twice as many
## open files as it has active connections, so if you have a few
## hundred or more users you will want to set this.
#
ULIMIT_MAX_FILES=40000
