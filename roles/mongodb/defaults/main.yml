# MongoDB (/library/dbdata/mongodb) greatly enhances the Sugarizer experience.
# The roles/mongodb playbook (was?) invoked by roles/sugarizer/meta/main.yml

# 2020-01-23: mongodb_install is completely ignored as MongoDB is installed on
# demand as a dependency -- by Sugarizer -- but for now we set fake value
# 'mongodb_install: True' for 'mongodb_installed is defined' tests e.g. in
# 0-init/tasks/validate_vars.yml

# mongodb_install: True

# FYI 'mongodb_enabled: False' works when Sugarizer is disabled.  Required by
# mongodb/tasks/enable.yml to shut down the service and log status, but that is
# misleading as Sugarizer starts mongodb's systemd service on its own, due to
# 'Requires=mongodb.service' within /etc/systemd/system/sugarizer.service

# mongodb_enabled: False

# mongodb_port: 27017

# All above are set in: github.com/iiab/iiab/blob/master/vars/default_vars.yml
# If nec, change them by editing /etc/iiab/local_vars.yml prior to installing!

mongodb_64bit_version: 4.4    # 5.0 also works as of 2022-06-09, but can fail
                              # on "pre-2011" CPU's that lack AVX.
