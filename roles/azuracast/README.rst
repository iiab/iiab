AzuraCast README
================

Install `AzuraCast <https://azuracast.com/>`_ to your Internet-in-a-Box (IIAB) if you want "radio station" functionality.  You and your community can then schedule podcasts, music, and even do live streaming of audio content (video streaming might also be possible in future!)

As soon as you install AzuraCast with IIAB, it can stream MP3 files (and similar files) using `LiquidSoap <https://docs.azuracast.com/en/developers/liquidsoap>`_ to help you schedule or randomize playback of MP3 songs (and similar).

Please see AzuraCast's `screenshots <https://www.google.com/search?q=azuracast+screenshot&tbm=isch>`_ and `docs <./README.rst#azuracast-docs>`_.

Optionally, live-streaming can also be made to work, e.g. if you install `Mixxx or BUTT <https://docs.azuracast.com/en/user-guide/streaming-software>`_ on your own.  If so, you have many options to configure streaming with `Icecast <https://icecast.org/>`_, `Shoutcast <https://www.shoutcast.com/>`_, etc.

Requirements
------------

AzuraCast recommends `2-to-4 GB RAM minimum <https://docs.azuracast.com/en/getting-started/requirements#system-requirements>`_.

As of 2022-08-31, AzuraCast should run on Ubuntu 22.04 and **64-bit** Raspberry Pi OS: `#1772 <https://github.com/iiab/iiab/issues/1772>`_, `AzuraCast/AzuraCast#332 <https://github.com/AzuraCast/AzuraCast/issues/332>`_, `PR #2946 <https://github.com/iiab/iiab/pull/2946>`_

Other Linux distributions may also work, at your own risk, especially if Docker runs smoothly.

Using It
--------

* Do a normal IIAB install (https://download.iiab.io), making sure to set both variables ``azuracast_install`` and ``azuracast_enabled`` to ``True`` when IIAB's installer prompts you to edit `/etc/iiab/local_vars.yml <http://FAQ.IIAB.IO#What_is_local_vars.yml_and_how_do_I_customize_it%3F>`_
* When the IIAB software install completes, it will ask you to reboot, and AzuraCast's console will then be available at http://box.lan:12080
* That console site will prompt you to complete AzuraCast's initial setup: user accounts, managing stations, radio streams, etc.
* Finally, check out some `how-to videos <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Rxlu5P804>`_ to learn to manage your own radio station!

NOTE: When creating a station using AzuraCast's console, its default streaming ports for ``station`` and ``autodj`` need to be in the `port range 12000-12100 <https://github.com/iiab/iiab/wiki/IIAB-Networking#list-of-ports--services>`_ (port 12443 may also be required!)
