# Idea: institute precautionary system-wide published password warning(s)
# for user iiab-admin / g0adm1n, i.e. {{ iiab_admin_user }} with password
# {{ iiab_admin_published_pwd }}, regardless whether the password is set:
#
# (1) by the OS installer
# (2) by the OS's graphical desktop tools
# (3) at the command-line: sudo passwd iiab-admin
# (4) by IIAB's 1-line installer: http://download.iiab.io
# (5) by this role: roles/iiab-admin/tasks/admin-user.yml
# (6) by IIAB's Admin Console during installation
# ...and/or...
# (7) by IIAB's Admin Console > Utilities > Change Password
