# 2019-03-07: This popup (/etc/xdg/lxsession/LXDE-pi/sshpwd-lxde-iiab.sh) does
# not actually appear when triggered by /etc/xdg/autostart/pprompt-iiab.desktop
# (or pprompt.desktop as Raspbian has working since 2018-11-13!)  Too bad as it
# would be really nice to standardize this popup across Ubermix & all distros..
# Is this a permissions/security issue presumably?  Official autostart spec is:
# https://specifications.freedesktop.org/autostart-spec/autostart-spec-latest.html
# Raspbian's 2016-2018 evolution here: https://github.com/iiab/iiab/issues/1537
