# Debian 10 "Buster" is apparently enabling AppArmor in 2019:
# https://wiki.debian.org/AppArmor/Progress
# https://wiki.debian.org/AppArmor/HowToUse
# https://packages.debian.org/buster/apparmor
# Curiously this has NOT stopped IIAB 7.0/master from working on Debian 10
# pre-releases, during @floydianslips' March 2019 testing anyway!  SEE #1387

# PR #2654 - AppArmor works w/ IIAB on Debian 10/11, so also now on Ubuntu?
