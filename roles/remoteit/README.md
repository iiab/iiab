# Remote support of an Internet-in-a-Box using https://remote.it

Remote.it can be a [great way](https://docs.remote.it/introduction/get-started/readme) to remotely support an Internet-in-a-Box (IIAB).

As of [April 2022](https://remote.it/pricing/), 5 IIAB devices can be managed for free, and an unlimited number can be managed for $6/month.

For other approaches, please see [FAQ.IIAB.IO](https://wiki.iiab.io/go/FAQ) -> "How can I remotely manage my Internet-in-a-Box?"

## Getting Started

### Create a remote.it account + consider its desktop application

1. Browse to [https://remote.it](https://remote.it) (Web Portal) and sign up for an account.

2. Consider downloading and installing the remote.it [desktop application](https://remote.it/download/) (e.g. for Windows, macOS or Linux) on your own laptop/computer.  Their https://remote.it Web Portal and [mobile apps](https://docs.remote.it/introduction/get-started/readme#installation-packages) are also sometimes sufficient, but less functional.

   COMPARISON: "The Desktop and [CLI](https://docs.remote.it/software/cli) can [each] support both peer to peer connections and proxy connections [whereas] the Web Portal and API can only support proxy connections" according to https://docs.remote.it/software/device-package/usage

<!-- ### Install remote.it onto an IIAB + register it + authorize services/ports -->
### OPTION #1: Generate a remote.it claim code for your IIAB + register it + authorize services/ports
<!-- ### OPTION #1: Run `sudo iiab-remoteit` to enable remote.it -->

Prerequisite: Find any IIAB with `remoteit_installed: True` in `/etc/iiab/iiab_state.yml` (this is the default!)  This means that the remote.it [Device Package](https://docs.remote.it/software/device-package) is already installed on your IIAB, most important.  It also means the _strictly optional_ `/usr/bin/remoteit` [command-line interface (CLI)](https://docs.remote.it/software/cli) is installed, offering [a few more features](https://support.remote.it/hc/en-us/articles/4412786750861-Install-the-remoteit-agent-on-your-device) than the Device Package.

1. Run `sudo iiab-remoteit` to enable remote.it on your IIAB:

   - Hit [Enter] (repeatedly if necessary, to accept all defaults) to quickly generate a claim code for your IIAB.

     The claim code must be used [within 24 hours](https://docs.remote.it/device-package/installation#2.-update-your-package-manager-and-install) (Step 2., below).

     Just FYI a copy is also put in: `/etc/remoteit/config.json`

   - EXCEPTION #1: If a remote.it license key happens to be found in `/etc/iiab/local_vars.yml` or `/etc/remoteit/registration`, that will be tried first (prior to, and instead of generating a claim code).

     *If the license key works, you will not get a claim code (as the IIAB device auto-registers to your remote.it account) so jump to Step 5. in OPTION #2.*

   - EXCEPTION #2: If you have an existing `/etc/remoteit/config.json` you will be given the option to try that (e.g. if you already registered the IIAB device to your remote.it account).

     *Verify that after `sudo iiab-remoteit` completes, by jumping to Step 5. in OPTION #2.*

<!--
1. Connect your IIAB device to the Internet.

2. If your IIAB software is already installed, run `sudo iiab-remoteit` then skip to Step 5. below.

3. If your IIAB software isn't yet installed, set `remoteit_install` and `remoteit_enabled` to `True` in its [/etc/iiab/local_vars.yml](https://wiki.iiab.io/go/FAQ#What_is_local_vars.yml_and_how_do_I_customize_it.3F)

   Install [IIAB software](https://download.iiab.io/) e.g. by running `sudo iiab` then follow any on-screen instructions &mdash; until "INTERNET-IN-A-BOX (IIAB) SOFTWARE INSTALL IS COMPLETE" eventually appears on screen.
-->

   <!-- , and when that's complete go directly to Step 3. below.

   Then install and enable remote.it (its [Device Package](https://docs.remote.it/software/device-package)) on your IIAB, by running:

   ```
   cd /opt/iiab/iiab
   sudo ./runrole remoteit
   ```

   Or if necessary reinstall the latest, by running:

   ```
   cd /opt/iiab/iiab
   sudo ./runrole --reinstall remoteit
   ``` -->

<!--
(This installs and enables the remote.it [Device Package](https://docs.remote.it/software/device-package) for your CPU and OS.  This also installs the _optional_ `/usr/bin/remoteit` [command-line interface (CLI)](https://docs.remote.it/software/cli), which offers [a few more features](https://support.remote.it/hc/en-us/articles/4412786750861-Install-the-remoteit-agent-on-your-device) than the Device Package.)

4. To obtain your IIAB's 8-character remote.it claim code (allowing you to make a remote connection to this IIAB device) run:

   ```
   sudo grep claim /etc/remoteit/config.json
   ```

   *The claim code must be used within 24 hours, per:* https://docs.remote.it/device-package/installation#2.-update-your-package-manager-and-install

   _If your claim code has expired, please run_ `sudo iiab-remoteit` _just as in Step 2._
-->

   <!-- If necessary, run this command to get a new claim code: *(adjust version & architecture in the .deb filename as appropriate!)*

   ```
   sudo apt install /opt/iiab/downloads/remoteit-4.14.1.armhf.rpi.deb
   ``` -->

2. Submit the claim code within the remote.it [desktop application](https://remote.it/download/) on your own laptop/computer.  Or if you prefer, do that by logging into their Web Portal at: https://remote.it
 
   Either way, click on the '+' icon to enter the remote.it claim code (to register the IIAB device to your remote.it account) as shown in this [screenshot](https://docs.remote.it/software/device-package/installation#3.-claim-and-register-the-device).

3. Authorize services/ports (e.g. SSH, HTTP, etc) for your IIAB device, as shown in these [screenshots](https://docs.remote.it/software/device-package/installation#4.-set-up-services-on-your-device), and you're all done!

   SUMMARY: One or more [remote.it "Services"](https://support.remote.it/hc/en-us/articles/360060992631-Services) need to be authorized (registered) to allow remote access to your IIAB device.

   EXAMPLES: Add an SSH Service on port 22 and/or add an HTTP Service on port 80 ([screenshot guide](https://support.remote.it/hc/en-us/articles/360058603991-Configuring-remoteit-Services-on-devices-with-remote-it-Desktop)).

### OPTION #2: Paste your remote.it license key to IIAB + enable it + authorize services/ports

1. Copy your remote.it account _license key_ from their Desktop Application (https://remote.it/download/) or from their Web Portal (https://remote.it) &mdash; as shown in this [screenshot](https://docs.remote.it/oem-and-bulk-provisioning/registration-into-a-users-account#3.-user-receives-the-device-and-registers-his-account).

   Paste it into your IIAB's [/etc/iiab/local_vars.yml](https://wiki.iiab.io/go/FAQ#What_is_local_vars.yml_and_how_do_I_customize_it.3F) as in this example:

   ```
   remoteit_license_key: 592AA9BB-XXXX-YYYY-ZZZZ-6E27654C3DF6
   ```

   _FYI to protect your credential, the above line will promptly be redacted (removed) from your /etc/iiab/local_vars.yml â€” after the key is copied to_ `/etc/remoteit/registration` _in Step 3. or 4. below._

2. Also set `remoteit_enabled: True` in /etc/iiab/local_vars.yml

   (And verify that `remoteit_install: True` is set.)

3. If your [IIAB software](https://download.iiab.io/) is _not yet installed,_ do that e.g. by running `sudo iiab` and following any on-screen instructions &mdash; until "INTERNET-IN-A-BOX (IIAB) SOFTWARE INSTALL IS COMPLETE" eventually appears on screen.

   When that's complete, skip to Step 5.

4. If your IIAB software is _already installed,_ make sure your IIAB is online.

   Now register the IIAB device to your remote.it account, by running `sudo iiab-remoteit` (this also enables remote.it on your IIAB).

   Or, if you prefer the legacy approach, run:

   ```
   cd /opt/iiab/iiab
   sudo ./runrole remoteit
   ```

   The legacy approach can also reinstall the (latest) remote.it Device Package on your IIAB, if you instead run:

   ```
   cd /opt/iiab/iiab
   sudo ./runrole --reinstall remoteit
   ```

5. Log in to https://remote.it or its [desktop application](https://remote.it/download/) on your own computer/laptop.
    
   In the ["Devices" section on the left](https://docs.remote.it/software/device-package/installation#3.-claim-and-register-the-device), check that your IIAB is now present (i.e. registered to your account).

6. Authorize services/ports (e.g. SSH, HTTP, etc) for your IIAB device, as shown in these [screenshots](https://docs.remote.it/software/device-package/installation#4.-set-up-services-on-your-device), and you're all done!

   SUMMARY: One or more [remote.it "Services"](https://support.remote.it/hc/en-us/articles/360060992631-Services) need to be authorized (registered) to allow remote access to your IIAB device.

   EXAMPLES: Add an SSH Service on port 22 and/or add an HTTP Service on port 80 ([screenshot guide](https://support.remote.it/hc/en-us/articles/360058603991-Configuring-remoteit-Services-on-devices-with-remote-it-Desktop)).

### How to I disable remote.it on my IIAB?

1. Run `sudo iiab-remoteit-off`

2. If you also want to completely remove all remote.it software and its settings, run:

   ```
   sudo apt purge "remoteit*"
   sudo rm /usr/bin/remoteit
   ```

## Known Issues

- <strike>2021-10-27: This needs to be enhanced rather urgently, so remote.it also works when IIAB is installed on Raspberry Pi OS 11 (Bullseye), Ubuntu, Mint and Debian: [#3006](https://github.com/iiab/iiab/issues/3006)</strike>
- <strike>2021-10-29: The above OS issues should be resolved by [PR #3007](https://github.com/iiab/iiab/pull/3007), [PR #3009](https://github.com/iiab/iiab/pull/3009) and [PR #3010](https://github.com/iiab/iiab/pull/3010) &mdash; but this needs final testing!  (Initial testing occurred on [1] 32-bit Raspberry Pi OS Lite on Raspberry Pi 4 and [2] Ubuntu Server 20.04 on x86_64 VM.)</strike>
