== 2-common README

This 2nd
https://github.com/iiab/iiab/wiki/IIAB-Contributors-Guide#ansible[stage]
is for OS-level basics _common_ to all platforms, i.e. core
prerequisites to building up a functioning
https://internet-in-a-box.org/[Internet-in-a-Box (IIAB)] server.

These are (partially) put in place:

* IIAB directory structure (link:tasks/fl.yml[file layout])
* Common https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APT_(software)[apt] software packages
* Networking apt packages (including many WiFi tools, and also iptables-persistent for the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iptables[iptables] firewall)
* link:tasks/iiab-startup.yml[/usr/libexec/iiab-startup.sh] similar to
AUTOEXEC.BAT and /etc/rc.local, in order to run jobs on boot

Recap: As with 0-init, 1-prep, 3-base-server, 4-server-options and
5-xo-services â€” this 2nd stage installs core server infra (that is not
user-facing).
