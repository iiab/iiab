      - avahi-daemon       # 2021-07-27: RaspiOS (and package libnss-mnds, below) install this regardless -- holdover from the XO days and used to advertise ssh/admin-console being available via avahi-daemon -- used with https://github.com/iiab/iiab/blob/master/roles/network/tasks/avahi.yml
      #- avahi-discover    # 2021-07-27: Commented out long ago
      - bzip2              # 2021-04-26: Prob not used, but can't hurt?
      - curl               # Used to install roles/nodejs and roles/nodered

      - gawk

      - logrotate
      - libnss-mdns        # 2021-07-27: RaspiOS (and package avahi-daemon, above) install this regardless -- client-side library -- provides name resolution via mDNS (Multicast DNS) using Zeroconf/Bonjour e.g. Avahi
      #- lynx              # Installed by 1-prep's roles/iiab-admin/tasks/access.yml

      - mlocate
      - net-tools          # 2021-04-26: @jvonau suggests possibly deleting this...unless oldtimers really want these older commands in iiab-diagnostics output?
      #- ntfs-3g           # 2021-07-31: RaspiOS installs this regardless -- but this should no longer be nec with 5.4+ kernels, similar to exfat packages above -- however, see also this symlink warning: https://superuser.com/questions/1050544/mount-with-kernel-ntfs-and-not-ntfs-3g -- and upcoming kernel 5.15 improvements: https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=New-NTFS-Likely-For-Linux-5.15
