  package:
    name:
      - acpid              #   55kB download: Daemon for ACPI (power mgmt) events
      - bzip2              #   47kB download: RasPiOS installs this regardless -- 2021-04-26: Prob not used, but can't hurt?
      - curl               #  254kB download: RasPiOS installs this regardless -- Used to install roles/nodejs and roles/nodered
      #- etckeeper         #   54kB download: "nobody is really using etckeeper and it's bloating the filesystem every time apt runs" per @jvonau at https://github.com/iiab/iiab/issues/1146
      #- exfat-fuse        #   28kB download: 2021-07-27: Should no longer be nec with 5.4+ kernels, so let's try commenting it out
      #- exfat-utils       #   41kB download: Ditto!  See also 'ntfs-3g' below
      - gawk               #  533kB download
      - htop               #  109kB download: RasPiOS installs this regardless
      - i2c-tools          #   78kB download: RasPiOS installs this regardless -- Low-level bus/chip/register/EEPROM tools e.g. for RTC
      - logrotate          #   67kB download: RasPiOS installs this regardless
      #- lynx              #  505kB download: Installed by 1-prep's roles/iiab-admin/tasks/main.yml
      #- make              #  376kB download: 2021-07-27: Currently used by roles/pbx and no other roles
      - mlocate            #   92kB download
      #- ntfs-3g           #  379kB download: RaspiOS installs this regardless -- 2021-07-31: But this should no longer be nec with 5.4+ kernels, similar to exfat packages above -- however, see also this symlink warning: https://superuser.com/questions/1050544/mount-with-kernel-ntfs-and-not-ntfs-3g -- and upcoming kernel 5.15 improvements: https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=New-NTFS-Likely-For-Linux-5.15
      #- openssh-server    #  318kB download: RasPiOS installs this regardless -- this is also installed by 1-prep's roles/sshd/tasks/main.yml to cover all OS's
      - pandoc             #   19kB download: For /usr/bin/iiab-refresh-wiki-docs
      - pastebinit         #   47kB download: For /usr/bin/iiab-diagnostics
      #- python3-pip       #  337kB download: RasPiOS installs this regardless -- 2021-07-29: And already installed by /opt/iiab/iiab/scripts/ansible -- this auto-installs 'python3-setuptools' and 'python3' etc
      #- python3-venv      # 1188kB download: RasPiOS installs this regardless -- 2021-07-30: For Ansible module 'pip' used in roles like {calibre-web, jupyterhub, lokole} -- whereas roles/kalite uses (virtual) package 'virtualenv' for Python 2 -- all these 3+1 IIAB roles install 'python3-venv' for themselves.  FYI: Debian 11 auto-installs 'python3-venv' when you install 'python3' -- whereas Ubuntu (e.g. 20.04 & 21.10) and RaspiOS 10 did not.
