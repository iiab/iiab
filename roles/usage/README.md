### Usage Statistics Describing WiFi Clients on IIAB Servers
Overview:

The *hostapd* program runs on the IIAB server, and manages all of the WiFi client connections. This **Usage** application records the identity and  byte counts for each connected device once every 2 minutes. It places this information into a sqlite3 database (/opt/iiab/clientlinfo.sqlite). The information in the database is summarized by a graphical output page at http://box.lan/admin/usage (requires the *Admin Console* username and password).
### What Questions Can the Usage Chart Answer?
The graphical user interface for an application is always a challenge. Here are the questions which the **Usage Chart** may be able to answer:
1. What happened in the classroom today?
    1. How much variation was there between the usage of data between indivitual students?
    2. How much are the computers being used during the day? In which class periods?
2. How does the usage today compare with earlier days, weeks, months?
### Some Examples
There are three main variables which can be selected independently in the **Usage Chart**:
    
1. What is displayed
    1. Computer devices -- even smart phones belonging to students, or classroom visitors  -- in separate bars.
    2. Usage: -- A pair of bars for each bucket:
        1. Number of minutes connected to the server.
        1. Number of megabytes transferred from the server to the client(s).
2. The size of the time bucket which is lumped into the two bars. 
3. The start date and end date for defining which data will be displayed. 
### How to use
Part of the challenge in testing and debugging an application such as **Usage Chart** is accumulating enough data to test the historical charts. The easiest is to accumulate for a few days, and then display the hourly buckets:
![](usage5.jpg)

This chart shows that I got up at about 7AM, and read the online NYTimes for quite a while. Then I had breakfast. and started again about 10AM.

Then I clicked the "Days" bucket, which groups all today's data into a single bucket, and how much connection and data I've used while over the last week. My computer stays connected, so the blue bars are always the same, and do not really indicate much useful information. When there is a whole classroom of computers, and some of them might not be turned on part of the time, the number of connection hours might be more useful.

The start and end date section always assumes that the user wants the end date to be now. If the user wanted to see the hourly chart for four weeks ago, she would click "week", and then click "earlier" 4 times, and then set end date with the keyboard to set the end of the desired week, and click "Redraw".

### Internals
The database update program, /usr/bin/iiab-wifidata.py, writes to the database (/opt/iiab/clientdata.sqlite) after using the ```"hostapd_cli all_sta"``` command to get the current WiFi statistics. This "cli" (command line interface) returns data that looks like this:
```
root@box:/opt/iiab/iiab# hostapd_cli all_sta
Selected interface 'wlan0'
20:c9:d0:b7:16:59
flags=[AUTH][ASSOC][AUTHORIZED][SHORT_PREAMBLE]
aid=1
capability=0x421
listen_interval=10
supported_rates=82 84 8b 96 24 30 48 6c 0c 12 18 60
timeout_next=NULLFUNC POLL
rx_packets=3167
tx_packets=1403
rx_bytes=419099
tx_bytes=308529
inactive_msec=0
connected_time=582
root@box:/opt/iiab/iiab# 
```
The iiab-wifidata.py program is started every two minutes by entries in /etc/crontab. This program runs to completion in about 200 mS.
```
# /etc/crontab: system-wide crontab
# m h dom mon dow user  command
*/2 * * * * root /usr/bin/iiab-wifidata.py
1  *  * * * root systemctl restart hostapd
```

The data items in the sqlite database are:
```
sqlite> .schema
CREATE TABLE connections (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,host_num TEXT, client_id TEXT, start_time_stamp TEXT,tx_bytes INTEGER, rx_bytes INTEGER,connected_time TEXT,connected_str TEXT,hour INTEGER,minute INTEGER,datestr TEXT,month INTEGER,day INTEGER,dow INTEGER,week INTEGER,doy INTEGER,datetime TEXT,year INTEGER,site TEXT);
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX client_id on connections (client_id,start_time_stamp);
CREATE TABLE lookup (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,host_num INTEGER, client_id TEXT,name TEXT);
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX lookup_index ON lookup (client_id);
sqlite> 
```
#### Security
The MAC address of each client is not recorded in the database, but rather the md5sum of the MAC address. Also the identity of the server is somewhat obscured, by using the UUID stored in /etc/iiab/uuid, for the site field.
