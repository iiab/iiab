# 2019-07-06: The 'monit' package was suddenly removed from Debian 10.0.0
# "Buster" during the very final days prior to release, as confirmed by the
# sudden disappearance of these 2 pages:
#
#   https://packages.debian.org/buster/monit
#   https://packages.debian.org/source/buster/monit
#
# And yet Raspbian Buster (is_raspbian_10, which confusingly IIAB declares to
# be is_debian_10 in vars/raspbian-10.yml for now!) still provides 'monit' via
# apt -- so eliminating "Debian 10+" requires this funky conditional:

- name: Install 'monit' if monit_install and not Debian 10+
  include_tasks: install.yml
  when: monit_install and not ((is_debian and not is_raspbian) and (not is_debian_8) and (not is_debian_9))
