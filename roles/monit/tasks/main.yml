# We assume 0-init/tasks/validate_vars.yml has DEFINITELY been run, so no need
# to re-check whether vars are defined here.  As Ansible vars cannot be unset:

# 2019-07-06: The 'monit' package was suddenly removed from Debian 10.0.0
# "Buster" during the very final days prior to release, as confirmed by the
# sudden disappearance of these 2 pages:
#
#   https://packages.debian.org/buster/monit
#   https://packages.debian.org/source/buster/monit
#
# And yet Raspbian Buster (is_raspbian_10, which confusingly IIAB declares to
# be is_debian_10 in vars/raspbian-10.yml for now!) still provides 'monit' via
# apt -- so eliminating "Debian 10+" requires this funky conditional:

# 2020-09-21: The 'monit' package appears to be returning to Debian 11, per:
#
#   https://packages.debian.org/bullseye/monit
#   https://packages.debian.org/source/bullseye/monit
