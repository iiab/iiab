# We assume 0-init/tasks/validate_vars.yml has DEFINITELY been run, so no need
# to re-check whether vars are defined here.  As Ansible vars cannot be unset:

  # 2019-07-06: The 'monit' package was suddenly removed from Debian 10.0.0
  # "Buster" during the very final days prior to release, as confirmed by the
  # sudden disappearance of these 2 pages:
  #
  #   https://packages.debian.org/buster/monit
  #   https://packages.debian.org/source/buster/monit
  #
  # And yet Raspbian Buster (is_raspbian_10, which confusingly IIAB declares to
  # be is_debian_10 in vars/raspbian-10.yml for now!) still provides 'monit' via
  # apt -- so eliminating "Debian 10+" requires this funky conditional:

  # 2020-09-21: The 'monit' package appears to be returning to Debian 11, per:
  #
  #   https://packages.debian.org/bullseye/monit
  #   https://packages.debian.org/source/bullseye/monit
  #
  # SEE iiab/iiab#1849 re: "Debian 10 Buster no longer includes Monit" etc.
