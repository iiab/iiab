# 4. RUN "npm install" TO POPULATE ~35MB /opt/iiab/sugarizer-server/node_modules (TWICE, BIG JOB THEN SMALL JOB)

# Re-running "npm install" USED TO fail on Raspbian 9 if not other OS's ?
# Strategies considered to avoid re-running it:
# OLD WAY 1: test & set flag node_modules_exists: True
# OLD WAY 2: "creates: ..." checks for non-existence of /opt/iiab/sugarizer-server-1.0/node_modules
# OLD WAY 3: set "register: git_sug_server_output" above, then as nec delete /opt/iiab/sugarizer-server-1.0/node_modules "when: git_sug_server_output.changed" and as nec run "npm install"

#- name: Check for /opt/iiab/sugarizer-server/node_modules
#  stat:
#    path: "{{ iiab_base }}/sugarizer-server/node_modules"
#  register: nmtest
#  ignore_errors: True
#
#- name: Set a flag to prevent re-running of "npm install"
#  set_fact:
#    node_modules_exists: True
#  when: nmtest.stat is defined and nmtest.stat.exists

# NEW WAY BELOW: run "npm install --allow-root" every time, as modern versions
# of npm are incremental, with sanity checks (all 3 may work: but npm 6.2.0
# is better than 5.6.0. which is better than Ubuntu 18.04's 3.5.2).

# 2018-07-15: TK Kang & Holt confirmed sudo-driven "npm install" maxes out CPU
# for hours, on diff OS's using npm 5.6.0 and 6.2.0.  Hours later you may get
# error: code EACCES, errno -13 (permission denied),
# "Missing write access to /opt/iiab/sugarizer-server-1.0/node_modules"
#
# SOLUTION: Implement '--allow-root --unsafe-perm=true' below, as is critical
# for 1st run of sudo-driven 'npm install' especially:
#
# ON DEBIAN: npm 5.6.0's --allow-root would be sufficient: causing creation
# of /root/.npm cache & lock files to owned by root:root instead of
# iiab-admin:iiab-admin...thus permitting it & IIAB installs to complete!
#
# ON RASPBIAN: npm 5.6.0's --unsafe-perm=true is *required* so that npm
# install actually finished (in about 5 minutes).  It's possible we should
# remove --allow-root in favor of --unsafe-perm=true alone.  But this needs
# testing on different Linuxes before proceeding.
#
# CLARIF 1: Something like 'chown -R root:root /root/.npm' would do the job,
# but cannot happen synchronously throughout the 1st run of 'npm install'
# (when it's needed!)  Similar to what --allow-root does on Debian.
#
# CLARIF 2: Ubuntu 18.04 is currently unaffected due to its ancient
# npm 3.5.2, which instead uses /home/iiab-admin/.npm (which remains owned
# by iiab-admin:iiab-admin, even with '--allow-root', but thankfully still
# gets the job done, for now!)

# 2019-02-02 No Longer Required thanks to @llaske's upstream fix:
# https://github.com/llaske/sugarizer-server/commit/46c4822bc7801ff8d621c22988aa4418359e7e19
## 2019-02-02: HACK WAS REQUIRED ON UBUNTU 18.04 so Sugarizer finds MongoDB
## after 1st reboot.  Otherwise "Waiting for DB..." appears every second as
## shown by "systemctl status sugarizer" and "journalctl -eu sugarizer".
## This does NOT affect Ubuntu 16.04 or Raspbian.  @jvonau wonders if U18.04's
## "nameserver 127.0.0.53" in /etc/resolv.conf is to blame?  @m-anish wondered
## if "bind_ip: 127.0.0.1" in /etc/mongod.conf was to blame as suggested by
## https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8904991/mongodb-cant-connect-to-localhost-but-can-connect-to-localhosts-ip-address
## But changing to "bind_ip: localhost" does not work with Sugarizer, and
## "bind_ip: 127.0.0.1,localhost" is not allowed.  BACKGROUND: PR #1430
#- name: Set MongoDB "server" from localhost to 127.0.0.1 in /opt/iiab/sugarizer-server/env/sugarizer.ini

# mongodb_port is set to 27017 in /opt/iiab/iiab/vars/default_vars.yml
