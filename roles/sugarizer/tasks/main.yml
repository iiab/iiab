# 0. CLEAN UP PRIOR VERSIONS OF SUGARIZER (NEEDS WORK!)

- name: Wipe /library/www/html/sugarizer* if installing sugarizer-1.0
  shell: "rm -rf {{ doc_root }}/sugarizer*"
  when: sugarizer_version == "sugarizer-1.0"

# 1. DOWNLOAD+LINK /opt/iiab/sugarizer

- name: Clone llaske/sugarizer ({{ sugarizer_git_version }}) from GitHub to /opt/iiab (MAY DOWNLOAD 600+ MB)
  git:
    repo: https://github.com/llaske/sugarizer
    dest: "{{ sugarizer_location }}/{{ sugarizer_version }}"
    version: "{{ sugarizer_git_version }}"
    force: yes
    depth: 1
  when: internet_available

- name: Create symbolic link /opt/iiab/sugarizer -> /opt/iiab/{{ sugarizer_version }}
  file:
    src: "{{ sugarizer_location }}/{{ sugarizer_version }}"
    dest: "{{ sugarizer_location }}/sugarizer"

# 2. DOWNLOAD+LINK /opt/iiab/sugarizer-server

# was flawed, as documented at:

# Versions of MongoDB, npm (& Node.js ?) matter!  Sugarizer 1.0 Context:
#    https://github.com/iiab/iiab/issues/798
# Going forward let's "git clone" IIAB's preferred versions, of sugarizer
# AND sugarizer-server, as specified in roles/sugarizer/defaults/main.yml

# 2018-07-14 BLOAT: git works well BUT even with "depth: 1"
# - 229MB is unfort downloaded to /opt/iiab/sugarizer/.git
# - 1.4MB is unfort downloaded to /opt/iiab/sugarizer-server/.git

# CLARIF: during repeat runs of "./runrole sugarizer", this git sync shows
# "changed" (whereas above git sync shows "ok").  Reason: "npm install"
# (below) modifies /opt/iiab/sugarizer-server/node_modules
- name: Clone llaske/sugarizer-server ({{ sugarizer_server_git_version }}) from GitHub to /opt/iiab
  git:

# 3. INSTALL A GOOD VERSION OF Node.js AND npm

- name: Set up Node.js 8.x apt sources (debuntu, but avoid ubuntu-18)
  shell: curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_8.x | bash -
  when: internet_available and is_debuntu and not is_ubuntu_18

- name: Install latest Node.js which includes /usr/bin/npm (debuntu, but avoid ubuntu-18)
  package:
    name: nodejs
    # name: nodejs=8.x
    state: latest
    # state: present
  when: internet_available and is_debuntu and not is_ubuntu_18

# 2018-07-14: BOTH STEPS ABOVE TAKE TIME, but Raspbian (apt offers npm
# 1.4.21) & Debian 9 (apt offers no npm!) STILL NEED the above
# nodesource.com approach to get a version of npm that works with Sugarizer:
# https://github.com/iiab/iiab/issues/798#issuecomment-404324530
#
# MORE POSITIVELY: this nodesource.com approach (brings in npm 5.6.0 with
# nodejs 8.11.3 for now, to any OS) would also work on Ubuntu 18.04, and
# might even bring about a sane consistency across mainline OS's?
#
# BUT FOR NOW: Ubuntu 18.04's apt (approach below) brings in npm 3.5.2,
# which appears suffic "SO FAR"?  18.04's nodejs 8.10.0 is more reassuring!

# CRAZY IDEA: most versions of npm can upgrade themselves to the latest
# (6.2.0 for now) using command "npm install -g npm", if that helps us in
# future, e.g. TK's memory issue etc?  If so, be CAREFUL this puts npm
# in /usr/local/bin on Ubuntu 18.04 -- unlike Ubuntu 16.04 and Raspbian
# where it upgrades /usr/bin/npm in place:
# https://askubuntu.com/questions/1036278/npm-is-incorrect-version-on-latest-ubuntu-18-04-installation

- name: Install Node.js and npm (ubuntu-18 or not debuntu)

# 4. RUN "npm install" TO POPULATE ~35MB /opt/iiab/sugarizer-server/node_modules

# Re-running "npm install" USED TO fail on Raspbian 9 if not other OS's ?
# Strategies considered to avoid re-running it:
# OLD WAY 1: test & set flag node_modules_exists: True
# OLD WAY 2: "creates: ..." checks for non-existence of /opt/iiab/sugarizer-server-1.0/node_modules
# OLD WAY 3: set "register: git_sug_server_output" above, then as nec delete /opt/iiab/sugarizer-server-1.0/node_modules "when: git_sug_server_output.changed" and as nec run "npm install"

#- name: Check for /opt/iiab/{{ sugarizer_server_version }}/node_modules
#  stat:
#    path: "{{ sugarizer_location }}/{{ sugarizer_server_version }}/node_modules"
#  register: nmtest
#  ignore_errors: true
#
#- name: Set a flag to prevent re-running of "npm install"
#  set_fact:
#    node_modules_exists: True
#  when: nmtest.stat is defined and nmtest.stat.exists

# NEW WAY BELOW: run "npm install --allow-root" every time, as modern versions
# of npm are incremental, with sanity checks (all 3 may work: but npm 6.2.0
# is better than 5.6.0. which is better than Ubuntu 18.04's 3.5.2).

# 2018-07-15: TK Kang & Holt confirmed sudo-driven "npm install" maxes out CPU
# for hours, on diff OS's using npm 5.6.0 and 6.2.0.  Hours later you may get
# error: code EACCES, errno -13 (permission denied),
# "Missing write access to /opt/iiab/sugarizer-server-1.0/node_modules"
#
# SOLUTION: Implement '--allow-root --unsafe-perm=true' below, as is critical
# for 1st run of sudo-driven 'npm install' especially:
#
# ON DEBIAN: npm 5.6.0's --allow-root would be sufficient: causing creation
# of /root/.npm cache & lock files to owned by root:root instead of
# iiab-admin:iiab-admin...thus permitting it & IIAB installs to complete!
#
# ON RASPBIAN: npm 5.6.0's --unsafe-perm=true is *required* so that npm
# install actually finished (in about 5 minutes).  It's possible we should
# remove --allow-root in favore of --unsafe-perm=true alone.  But this needs
# testing on different Linuxes before proceeding.
#
# CLARIF 1: Something like 'chown -R root:root /root/.npm' would do the job,
# but cannot happen synchronously throughout the 1st run of 'npm install'
# (when it's needed!)  Similar to what --allow-root does on Debian.
#
# CLARIF 2: Ubuntu 18.04 is currently unaffected due to its ancient
# npm 3.5.2, which instead uses /home/iiab-admin/.npm (which remains owned
# by iiab-admin:iiab-admin, even with '--allow-root', but thankfully still
# gets the job done, for now!)
