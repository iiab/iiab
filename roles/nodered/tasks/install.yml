# BRUTAL but ensures consistency across OS's / distros like Raspbian Desktop &
# Ubermix that often include an older version of Node-RED.  Brutal, as this
# removes customizations on graphical desktop OS's e.g. Raspbian Desktop's:
#   1. Node-RED's icon (Raspberry Menu in top-left -> Programming -> Node-RED)
#   2. scripts like {node-red-start, node-red-stop, node-red-log} in /usr/bin
