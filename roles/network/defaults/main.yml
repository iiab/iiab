# Firewall (iptables) can be tuned in /etc/iiab/local_vars.yml with this var:
# ports_externally_visible: 3
# https://github.com/iiab/iiab/wiki/IIAB-Networking#firewall-iptables

# Ethernet - IF NECESSARY, CUSTOMIZE THESE 4+1 VARS IN /etc/iiab/local_vars.yml
# See "How do I set a static IP address?" for Ethernet, in http://FAQ.IIAB.IO
