# 2022-03-16: 'apt show <pkg> | grep Size' revealed download sizes, on 64-bit RasPiOS with desktop.

- name: Install dnsmasq -- configure LATER in 'network', after Stage 9
  include_tasks: roles/network/tasks/dnsmasq.yml

- name: Install package networkd-dispatcher (OS's other than RasPiOS)
  package:
    name: networkd-dispatcher    # 15kB download: Dispatcher service for systemd-networkd connection status changes
    state: present
  when: not is_raspbian

# 2021-07-27 from @jvonau: 3 apt packages BELOW (iw, rfkill, wireless-tools)
# are provided by RasPiOS.  Ubuntu|Debian on the other hand are hit or miss:
# desktops might have some/all 3 preinstalled, while servers tend not to have
# these present at all, but need to be installed if you want to take full
# advantage of WiFi on Ubuntu and friends.
#
# 2022-03-16 update: Let's make these 3 mandatory as they're only 300kB (grand
# total download size) and they can help IIAB field operators with BOTH
# (1) internal WiFi AND (2) USB WiFi devices inserted anytime/later.

- name: 'Install 11 network packages: avahi-daemon, hostapd, iproute2, iptables-persistent, iw, libnss-mdns, netmask, net-tools, rfkill, wpasupplicant, wpasupplicant -- later used by https://github.com/iiab/iiab/tree/master/roles/network'
  package:
    name:
      - avahi-daemon           #   97kB download: RasPiOS (and package libnss-mnds, below) install this regardless -- holdover from the XO days and used to advertise ssh/admin-console being available via avahi-daemon -- used with https://github.com/iiab/iiab/blob/master/roles/network/tasks/avahi.yml
      #- avahi-discover        #   46kB download: 2021-07-27: Commented out long ago
      - hostapd                #  764kB download: IEEE 802.11 AP and IEEE 802.1X/WPA/WPA2/EAP Authenticator -- has its service masked out of the box, and only used when IIAB's network roles detects the presence of WiFi and an AP is desired
      #- inetutils-syslogd     #  240kB download: 2021-07-27: Error logging facility -- holdover from the XO days, journalctl has replaced this in newer distros
      - iproute2               #  902kB download: RasPiOS installs this regardless -- the new networking and traffic control tools, meant to replace net-tools
      - iptables-persistent    #   12kB download: Boot-time loader for netfilter rules, iptables (firewall) plugin -- however Netfilter / nftables is ever moving forward so keep an eye on it!
      - iw                     #   97kB download: RasPiOS installs this regardless -- configure Linux wireless devices -- hard dependence for ap0 creation, SEE https://github.com/iiab/iiab/blob/master/roles/network/templates/hostapd/iiab-clone-wifi.service.j2
      - libnss-mdns            #   27kB download: RasPiOS (and package avahi-daemon, above) install this regardless -- client-side library -- provides name resolution via mDNS (Multicast DNS) using Zeroconf/Bonjour e.g. Avahi
      - netmask                #   25kB download: Handy utility -- helps determine network masks
      - net-tools              #  248kB download: RasPiOS installs this regardless -- @jvonau suggests possibly deleting this...unless oldtimers really want these older commands in iiab-diagnostics output?
      - rfkill                 #   87kB download: RasPiOS installs this regardless -- enable & disable wireless devices
      - wireless-tools         #  112kB download: RasPiOS installs this regardless -- manipulate Linux Wireless Extensions
      - wpasupplicant          # 1188kB download: RasPiOS installs this regardless -- client library for connections to a WiFi AP
