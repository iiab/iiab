# rpi_debian.yml
# Start out making simplifying assumptions
#   1. we are dealing with a rpi3
#   2. Gui inputs define the config -- auto config is more difficult
#      a. gui_desired_network_role
#      b. hostapd_enabled
#      c. gui_static_wan_ip
#   3. In appliance mode: wan is either wired dhcp/static or wlan0 and hostapd off
#   4. In lan_controller: wan is off, eth0 and wlan0 under br0
#   5. In gateway: user gateway is wan, and wlan0 under br0 if not acting as
#      the gateway
