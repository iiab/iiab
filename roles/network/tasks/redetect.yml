# The preferred method of disabling the LAN would be to set xsce_lan_enabled:
# False before getting here but we are here...
# Well if we got here something changed with the gateway and ifcfg-WAN maybe 
# no longer accurate. Note if DEVICE= is any ifcfg files the listed DEVICE 
# becomes bound to the NAME in the ifcfg file. With the LAN files out of the 
# way we can try the interfaces one by one starting with device_gw.

# Setting up three way conditions with the results
# skipped|changed|failed
# failure results in blowing away the ifcfg-WAN so lets make sure...  

# We only got here by way of no detected gateway, lets see if we can pick-up 
# transient change like cable issues.
