    # 2025-03-21 #3961 WARNING: RasPiOS standard wifi firmware for RPi 4, 5, 500
    # [ /lib/firmware/cypress/cyfmac43455-sdio-standard.bin i.e. BCM4345/6 wl0:
    # Aug 29 2023 01:47:08 version 7.45.265 (28bca26 CY) FWID 01-b677b91b ] was
    # crashing OFTEN during NM-debian.yml restart of NetworkManager.  Similarly,
    # 'nmcli radio wifi off; nmcli radio wifi on' OFTEN triggers crashes on bare
    # RasPiOS, as seen by: watch -n0 "iw reg get; iw dev; echo; dmesg | grep Firmware:"

    # Workarounds with potential: (discussed on PR #3965)
    # (1) Defer the setting of wifi country code (moved from just above
    #     NM-debian.yml, to just below) -- tested to work well.
    # (2) iiab-clone-wifi.service.j2 can add ap0 to the correct phyname
    #     {phy0, phy1, ...} -- tested to work well.
    # (3) raspberrypi/linux#6049 hack holds promise, adding brcmfmac.roamoff=1
    #     brcmfmac.feature_disable=0x282000 to /boot/firmware/cmdline.txt (then
    #     reboot) -- or add similar to /etc/modprobe.d/brcmfmac.conf (then reload
    #     kernel module brcmfmac).  Well-tested workarounds above mean this hack
    #     appears unnecessary: either as a one-off during IIAB install (carefully
    #     avoiding reboots), or by deviating from RasPiOS longer term which risks
    #     problematic side effects with other/past/future WiFi firmware -- or on
    #     other hardware -- perhaps making IIAB microSD cards less portable.

    # 2024-12-18: As `rfkill unblock wifi` formerly in rpi_debian.yml wasn't
    # enough, especially with NM (NetworkManager)
    # 2025-07-19: Use 2 additional sudo's below, for RasPiOS with desktop, to
    # restore $SUDO_UID to the correct value (1000 for default graphical
    # session) required by raspi-config -> do_wifi_country ->
    # /usr/bin/wfpanelctl netman cset -> D-Bus -- otherwise the raspi-config
    # command often fails (e.g. when operator's run sudo, via
    # /usr/local/bin/iiab-network etc) -- leading Ansible to convey an
    # unworkable SUDO_UID=0 or SUDO_UID=1001 ETC: "Failed to open connection to
    # \"session\" message bus: Failed to connect to socket /run/user/0/bus: No
    # such file or directory" -- arising from original commit "Update panel
    # wifi country flag after setting" of Feb 16, 2024:
    # https://github.com/RPi-Distro/raspi-config/commit/654184f40ffdbad093fd1017c08bf261abb49e7c
    - name: Run "sudo -u '#1000' sudo raspi-config nonint do_wifi_country {{ host_country_code }}" (using var host_country_code) to unblock WiFi, if RasPiOS -- this sets SUDO_UID=1000 (otherwise raspi-config often fails on RasPiOS with desktop)
