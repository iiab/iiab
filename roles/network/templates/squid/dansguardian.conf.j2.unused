# If phrasefiltermode and preserve case are both 2, this equates to 4 phrase

# worry, and need to filter pages in exotic character encodings, it may be
# better to run two instances on separate servers: one with preservecase 1
# (and possibly forcequicksearch 1) and non ASCII/UTF-8 phrase lists, and one
# with preservecase 0 and ASCII/UTF-8 lists.

# Download Managers
# These handle downloads of files to be filtered and scanned.
# They differ in the method they deal with large downloads.
# Files usually need to be downloaded 100% before they can be
# filtered and scanned before being sent on to the browser.
# Normally the browser can just wait, but with content scanning,
# for example to AV, the browser may timeout or the user may get
# confused so the download manager has to do some sort of
# 'keep alive'.
#
# There are various methods possible but not all are included.
# The author does not have the time to write them all so I have
# included a plugin systam.  Also, not all methods work with all
# browsers and clients.  Specifically some fancy methods don't
# work with software that downloads updates.  To solve this,
# each plugin can support a regular expression for matching
# the client's user-agent string, and lists of the mime types
# and extensions it should manage.
#
# Note that these are the matching methods provided by the base plugin
# code, and individual plugins may override or add to them.
# See the individual plugin conf files for supported options.
#
# The plugins are matched in the order you specify and the last
# one is forced to match as the default, regardless of user agent
# and other matching mechanisms.

# for example to AV scan.  The options are limitless.  Eventually all of
# DansGuardian will be plugin based.  You can have more than one content
# scanner. The plugins are run in the order you specify.
# This is one of the few places you can have multiple options of the same name.

# handled according to the settings of the user's filter group.
# Multiple plugins can be specified, and will be queried in order until one
# of them either finds a username or throws an error. For example, if Squid
# is configured with both NTLM and Basic auth enabled, and both the 'proxy-basic'
# and 'proxy-ntlm' auth plugins are enabled here, then clients which do not support
# NTLM can fall back to Basic without sacrificing access rights.

# latter in their original state to effectively be converted into grey requests.
