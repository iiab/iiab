# 2020-01-23: postgresql_install is completely ignored as PostgreSQL is
# installed on demand as a dependency -- by Moodle &/or Pathagar as nec --
# but for now we set fake value 'postgresql_install: True' for
# 'postgresql_installed is defined' tests e.g. in 0-init/tasks/validate_vars.yml

# postgresql_install: True
# postgresql_enabled: False

# All above are set in: github.com/iiab/iiab/blob/master/vars/default_vars.yml
# If nec, change them by editing /etc/iiab/local_vars.yml prior to installing!
