# 2020-01-21: Ansible Input Validation (basic sanity checking for now) to check
# that *_install and *_enabled variables (as set in places like
# /etc/iiab/local_vars.yml) appear coherent i.e. (1) are confirmed defined,
# (2) have type boolean (Ansible often inverts logic when boolean vars are
# accidentally declared as strings, see below!) and (3) have plausible values.

# 2020-01-23: *_installed variables (incrementally saved to
# /etc/iiab/iiab_state.yml) are not required to be boolean (or even defined!)
# for now.  However if any of these are defined, the corresponding value of
# *_install must be True, as IIAB does not currently support uninstalling!

# Stricter validation is needed later, when roles/playbooks/tasks are invoked
# by various scripts, possibly bypassing 0-init?  Either way, risks abound :/

# 1. "Ansible 2.8+ ADVISORY: avoid warnings by using 'when: var | bool' for
# top-level BARE vars (in case they're strings, instead of boolean)"
# https://github.com/iiab/iiab/issues/1632

# 2. "How Exactly Does Ansible Parse Boolean Variables?"
# https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47877464/how-exactly-does-ansible-parse-boolean-variables/47877502#47877502
# ...is very helpful but has it slightly wrong, as Ansible implements only ~18
# of YAML's 22 definitions of boolean (https://yaml.org/type/bool.html).
# i.e. Ansible fails to implement y|Y|n|N, only allowing ~18 boolean values:
#
# yes|Yes|YES|no|No|NO
# |true|True|TRUE|false|False|FALSE
# |on|On|ON|off|Off|OFF
#
# Otherwise 'var != (var | bool)' is dangerously common, e.g. (1) when a var
# is not one of the above ~18 words (forcing it to become a string) or (2) when
# a var is accidentally set using quotes (forcing it to become a string) these
# ~18 words too WILL FAIL as strings (as will any non-empty string...so beware
# casting strings to boolean later on...can make the situation worse!)
