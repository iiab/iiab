# - Validate input vars apache_install & apache_enabled here.  Use them as nec.
# - Encapsulate all 3 tasks below into httpd/roles/install.yml ?
# - Similarly sanity-check httpd/roles/enable.yml...
#   - Verify that 9-local-addons/tasks/main.yml's invocation of
#     roles/httpd/tasks/enable.yml (via roles/httpd-enable/tasks/main.yml, if
#     apache_enabled is True) does the right thing!
#   - And that we really don't want to invoke it hereunder?
# - Save relevant apache_* vars to /etc/iiab/iiab.ini
