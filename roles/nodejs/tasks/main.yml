# 2019-01-16: duplicate Node.js code unified thanks to @jvonau. It's used by:
#   roles/sugarizer/tasks/main.yml with roles/sugarizer/meta/main.yml
#   roles/nodered/tasks/main.yml   with roles/nodered/meta/main.yml

# 2019-01-16: fyi Node.js 10.x became "LTS" on 2018-10-30 but distros are
# holding back for now: certainly Ubuntu 18.04 and even Debian 10/Buster
# ("testing" branch) both install Node.js 8.x (instead of 10.x).  While the
# more bleeding-edge Debian Sid ("unstable" branch) does install Node.js 10.x
#
# This May Change: thanks all for running "apt -a list nodejs" on Buster's
# daily builds @ www.debian.org/devel/debian-installer/ to keep us informed!

- name: Set up Node.js 8.x apt sources (debuntu distros UP TO 2017)
  shell: curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_8.x | bash -
  args:
    warn: no
  when: internet_available and (is_debian_8 or is_debian_9 or is_ubuntu_16 or is_ubuntu_17)
  # NOT NEC TO TEST FOR is_raspbian_8 OR is_raspbian_9 AS /opt/iiab/iiab/vars/<OS>.yml
  # DEFINES THESE AS SUBSETS OF is_debian_8 OR is_debian_9 (FOR NOW!)

- name: Install latest Node.js which includes /usr/bin/npm (debuntu distros UP TO 2017)
  package:
    name: nodejs
    # name: nodejs=8.x
    state: latest
    # state: present
  when: internet_available and (is_debian_8 or is_debian_9 or is_ubuntu_16 or is_ubuntu_17)

# 2018-07-14: BOTH STEPS ABOVE TAKE TIME, but Raspbian (apt offers npm
# 1.4.21) & Debian 9 (apt offers no npm!) STILL NEED the above
# nodesource.com approach to get a version of npm that works with Sugarizer:
# https://github.com/iiab/iiab/issues/798#issuecomment-404324530
#
# MORE POSITIVELY: this nodesource.com approach (brings in npm 5.6.0 with
# nodejs 8.11.3 for now, to any OS) would also work on Ubuntu 18.04, and
# might even bring about a sane consistency across mainline OS's?
#
# BUT FOR NOW: Ubuntu 18.04's apt (approach below) brings in npm 3.5.2,
# which appears suffic "SO FAR"?  18.04's nodejs 8.10.0 is more reassuring!

# CRAZY IDEA: most versions of npm can upgrade themselves to the latest
# (6.2.0 for now) using command "npm install -g npm", if that helps us in
# future, e.g. TK's memory issue etc?  If so, be CAREFUL this puts npm
# in /usr/local/bin on Ubuntu 18.04 -- unlike Ubuntu 16.04 and Raspbian
# where it upgrades /usr/bin/npm in place:
