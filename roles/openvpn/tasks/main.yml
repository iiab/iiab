# CLARIF: plus signs (+) in public keys cause duplicate key additions (above)
# and failure during removal (below) as "+" has a special meaning as
# interpreted in a Python regexp, as implemented by Ansible's lineinfile module:
# https://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html

# WORKAROUND: the tail end of each public key (after the last plus sign) is
# being used (instead of the full key) as an abbreviated regexp for now.
# A backslash in front of each plus sign (+) would also work.

# AUGUST 2018: Unexplainably, stanza below had to be placed underneath ANY
# "lineinfile: ... state: absent" stanza to make openvpn_handle propagate
# properly to xscenet.net (monitoring ncat's erroneous handle parameter by
# observing "systemctl status openvpn@xscenet" helped trace the [primary?]
# bug to roles/openvpn/templates/announcer [far better now if not perfect?])
# Earlier "./runrole openvpn" had to be run twice to transmit
# /etc/iiab/openvpn_handle to xscenet.net -- and
# "systemctl restart openvpn@xscenet" was failing completely (no matter how
# many times it was run) to transmit /etc/iiab/openvpn_handle to xscenet.net

#    /lib/systemd/systemd-sysv-install  sets /etc/rc*.d/S|K01openvpn
