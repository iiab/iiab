# CLARIF: plus signs (+) in public keys cause duplicate key additions (above)
# and failure during removal (below) as "+" has a special meaning as
# interpreted in a Python regexp, as implemented by Ansible's lineinfile module:
# https://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html

# WORKAROUND: the tail end of each public key (after the last plus sign) is
# being used (instead of the full key) as an abbreviated regexp for now.
# A backslash in front of each plus sign (+) would also work.

# TO DO: WRAP COMMENTS + 4 ACTIVE STANZAS BELOW INTO enable.yml...

# FIXED SOMETIME PRIOR TO AUGUST 2018: earlier versions of Ansible had not
# been working with systemd service names that contained the "@" character.

#- name: Enable the OpenVPN tunnel at boot time (debuntu)
#  shell: systemctl enable openvpn@xscenet.service
#  when: openvpn_enabled and not stat.exists is defined and is_debuntu

#- name: Enable the OpenVPN tunnel at boot time (debuntu)

#- name: Start the OpenVPN tunnel now
#  shell: systemctl start openvpn@xscenet.service
#  when: openvpn_enabled and not stat.exists is defined and not installing

# AUGUST 2018: Unexplainably, stanza below had to be placed underneath ANY
# "lineinfile: ... state: absent" stanza to make openvpn_handle propagate
# properly to xscenet.net (monitoring ncat's erroneous handle parameter by
# observing "systemctl status openvpn@xscenet" helped trace the [primary?]
# bug to roles/openvpn/templates/announcer [far better now if not perfect?])
# Earlier "./runrole openvpn" had to be run twice to transmit
# /etc/iiab/openvpn_handle to xscenet.net -- and
# "systemctl restart openvpn@xscenet" was failing completely (no matter how
# many times it was run) to transmit /etc/iiab/openvpn_handle to xscenet.net

# 2018-09-02: OpenVPN had been starting tunnels by accident after reboot,
# with new IIAB installs.  Fix below (https://github.com/iiab/iiab/pull/1079)

#    /etc/network/if-up.d/openvpn       appears to auto-start xscenet.conf
#    /lib/systemd/systemd-sysv-install  sets /etc/rc*.d/S|K01openvpn
