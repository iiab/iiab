# Run 'sudo iiab-support' to turn on OpenVPN without hassle.  GENERAL TIPS:
# http://FAQ.IIAB.IO -> "How can I remotely manage my Internet-in-a-Box?"


# AUGUST 2018 - AUGUST 2021

# (1) openvpn_handle could no longer be left undefined OR null
# (two different concepts in Ansible, see /opt/iiab/iiab/test.yml)

# 2021-08-19 UPDATE: the /usr/bin/iiab-support command can now handle almost
# any /etc/iiab/local_vars.yml (PR #2957) making it all much more resilient!

# (2) openvpn_handle: "" (EMPTY STRING) IS HOWEVER TOLERATED -- in which case
# the OpenVPN server instead tries to use the 1st 6 chars of /etc/iiab/uuid

# (3) Finally if there's no UUID, the OpenVPN server falls back to labelling
# that machine as generic: "client1's certificate"
