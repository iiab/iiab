# AUGUST 2018: Unexplainably, stanza below had to be placed underneath ANY
# "lineinfile: ... state: absent" stanza to make openvpn_handle propagate
# properly to xscenet.net (monitoring ncat's erroneous handle parameter by
# observing "systemctl status openvpn@xscenet" helped trace the [primary?]
# bug to roles/openvpn/templates/announcer [far better now if not perfect?])
# Earlier "./runrole openvpn" had to be run twice to transmit
# /etc/iiab/openvpn_handle to xscenet.net -- and
# "systemctl restart openvpn@xscenet" was failing completely (no matter how
# many times it was run) to transmit /etc/iiab/openvpn_handle to xscenet.net
