# FIXED SOMETIME PRIOR TO AUGUST 2018: earlier versions of Ansible had not
# been working with systemd service names that contained the "@" character.

#- name: Enable the OpenVPN tunnel at boot time (debuntu)
#  shell: systemctl enable openvpn@xscenet.service
#  when: openvpn_enabled and not stat.exists is defined and is_debuntu

#- name: Enable the OpenVPN tunnel at boot time (debuntu)
#  shell: update-rc.d openvpn enable
#  when: openvpn_enabled and not stat.exists is defined and is_debuntu

#- name: Start the OpenVPN tunnel now
#  shell: systemctl start openvpn@xscenet.service
#  when: openvpn_enabled and not stat.exists is defined and not installing

# AUGUST 2018: Unexplainably, stanza below had to be placed underneath ANY
# "lineinfile: ... state: absent" stanza to make openvpn_handle propagate
# properly to xscenet.net (monitoring ncat's erroneous handle parameter by
# observing "systemctl status openvpn@xscenet" helped trace the [primary?]
# bug to roles/openvpn/templates/announcer [far better now if not perfect?])
# Earlier "./runrole openvpn" had to be run twice to transmit
# /etc/iiab/openvpn_handle to xscenet.net -- and
# "systemctl restart openvpn@xscenet" was failing completely (no matter how
# many times it was run) to transmit /etc/iiab/openvpn_handle to xscenet.net

# 2018-09-02: OpenVPN had been starting tunnels by accident after reboot,
# with new IIAB installs.  Fix below (https://github.com/iiab/iiab/pull/1079)
# changes most all instances below from CHILD service "openvpn@xscenet" to
# PARENT service "openpvn".  See these critical files to understand why:
#
#    /etc/default/openvpn               implies AUTOSTART="all"
#    /etc/init.d/openvpn                has AUTOSTART="all"
#    /etc/openvpn/xscenet.conf          our VPN connection
#    /etc/network/if-up.d/openvpn       appears to auto-start xscenet.conf
#    /lib/systemd/systemd-sysv-install  sets /etc/rc*.d/S|K01openvpn
#                                       e.g. when "systemctl enable openvpn"

  systemd:
    name: openvpn
    daemon_reload: yes
    enabled: yes
    state: restarted    # 2018-09-02: Should we be concerned that "systemctl status openvpn" often shows "active (exited)" ?  If so we might consider "state: started" or "state: reloaded" instead?
  when: openvpn_enabled | bool

- name: Enable hourly cron job for OpenVPN (starts CHILD service openvpn@xscenet, typically for CentOS only?)
  lineinfile:

    line: "25 *  *  *  * root (/usr/bin/systemctl start openvpn@xscenet.service) > /dev/null"
