# TO DO: BOTH CRON ENTRIES BELOW *SHOULD* BE DELETED "when: not kiwix_enabled"

# In the past kiwix-serve did not stay running, so we'd been doing this hourly.
# @mgautierfr & others suggest kiwix-serve might be auto-restarted w/o cron in
# future, whenever service fails, if this really catches all cases??
