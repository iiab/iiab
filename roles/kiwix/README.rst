KIWIX README
============

Kiwix is a set of Zim File readers from http://www.kiwix.org/wiki/Main_Page
We are using the kiwix-serve and kiwix-manage executables to setup and
render wikipedia and other web sources in zim format.

Locations
---------

- The ZIM files are expected to be in /library/zims/content
- The ZIM index files are expected to be in directories under /library/zims/index
- The URL is /kiwix

The library.xml file can be recalculated by running iiab-make-kiwix-lib.
