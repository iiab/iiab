Kiwix develops ZIM file creation & rendering tools for offline action,
as summarized at: https://wiki.kiwix.org/wiki/Software

Internet-in-a-Box uses `kiwix-tools <https://github.com/kiwix/kiwix-tools>`_ executables like kiwix-manage, kiwix-serve and kiwix-search (in
``/opt/iiab/kiwix/bin``) to set up and render ZIM files (such as Wikipedia, and
other educational materials) typically from https://download.kiwix.org/zim/

Locations
---------

- Your ZIM files go in ``/library/zims/content``
- Your ZIM index files used to go in directories under ``/library/zims/index`` (these index files are increasingly no longer necessary, as most ZIM files produced since 2017 contain an internal search index instead!)
- The URL is http://box/kiwix or http://box.lan/kiwix (both proxied for AWStats)
- Use URL http://box:3000/kiwix if you want to avoid the proxy

Your ``/library/zims/library.xml`` (containing essential metadata for the ZIM files you've installed) can be regenerated if necessary, by running:
``/usr/bin/iiab-make-kiwix-lib``
