# April/May 2018: Raspbian .deb's for the latest Calibre now appear
# (http://raspbian.raspberrypi.org/raspbian/pool/main/c/calibre/)
# within about 10 days of Calibre's quasi-monthly releases
# (https://calibre-ebook.com/whats-new).

# If you want the latest Calibre, run the appropriate below script, standalone.
# HOWEVER: it's strongly suggested you wait for apt (blessed by your OS!)

#- name: Install packages that Raspbian .deb's had installed for Calibre 3.23 (rpi)
#  #command: scripts/calibre-install-latest-rpi.sh  # FAILS with Calibre 3.24+ ("calibre : Depends: python-pyqt5 (>= 5.10.1+dfsg-2) but 5.10.1+dfsg-1+rpi1 is to be installed") since June 2018.
#  command: scripts/calibre-install-packages.sh     # BORROWED package list from /var/log/apt/history.log (that resulted from 2018-05-22 install of Calibre 3.23 using calibre-install-latest-rpi.sh).
#  when: is_rpi and internet_available

#- name: Upgrade to latest Calibre using Debian's own .deb's from testing (rpi)
#  command: scripts/calibre-install-latest.sh       # NECESSARY since Calibre 3.24 (BEWARE installing libc6 will prevent boot in RPi Zero W, i.e. if calibre-install-packages.sh isn't run above!)
#  when: is_rpi and internet_available

- name: Upgrade to latest Calibre using .deb's from testing (rpi)
  command: scripts/calibre-install-latest-rpi-plus.sh    # HOPE IT WORKS FOR Calibre 3.27.1+ starting 2018-07-22 -- PLEASE TEST IF BOOTABLE IN Zero W?
  #command: scripts/calibre-install-latest-rpi.sh    # WORKED FOR Calibre 3.26.x (Calibre 3.24.x & 3.25 required above prereq calibre-install-packages.sh then Debian's own calibre-install-latest.sh to be bootable in Zero W)
