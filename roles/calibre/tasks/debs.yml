# April/May 2018: Raspbian .deb's for the latest Calibre now appear
# (http://raspbian.raspberrypi.org/raspbian/pool/main/c/calibre/)
# within about 10 days of Calibre's quasi-monthly releases

# If you want the latest Calibre, run the appropriate below script, standalone.
# HOWEVER: it's strongly suggested you wait for apt (blessed by your OS!)
