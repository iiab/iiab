# calibre_via_debs MUST BE TRUE IN ORDER FOR roles/calibre/tasks/main.yml TO
# INVOKE THIS SCRIPT.  As of 2019-05-30, that means these 4 OS's:
#
# /opt/iiab/iiab/vars/raspbian-8.yml
# /opt/iiab/iiab/vars/raspbian-9.yml
# /opt/iiab/iiab/vars/raspbian-10.yml
# /opt/iiab/iiab/vars/debian-10.yml
#
# As viewable live @ https://github.com/iiab/iiab/tree/master/vars

# If you want the latest Calibre, run the appropriate script below, standalone.
# HOWEVER: it's strongly suggested you wait for apt (blessed by your OS!) to
# avoid ongoing dependency problems, as Calibre frequently demands the very
# latest/unstable dependencies.

# FYI Raspbian .deb's for the latest Calibre can be downloaded from either:
# http://raspbian.raspberrypi.org/raspbian/pool/main/c/calibre/
# http://archive.raspbian.org/raspbian/pool/main/c/calibre/
# ...within about 10 days after Calibre's quasi-monthly releases at:
# https://calibre-ebook.com/whats-new

#- name: Install packages that Raspbian .deb's had installed for Calibre 3.23 (rpi)
#  command: scripts/calibre-install-packages.sh    # BORROWED package list from /var/log/apt/history.log (that resulted from 2018-05-22 install of Calibre 3.23 using calibre-install-latest-rpi.sh).

#- name: Upgrade to latest Calibre using Debian's own .deb's from testing (rpi)
#  command: scripts/calibre-install-latest.sh    # WAS NEC with Calibre 3.24+ & Calibre 3.29 on 2018-08-21 (PR #1015), as all above strategies failed (only script that was not attempted: Sid-like calibre-install-unstable.sh).  CLARIF: RESULTING microSD's ARE NOT BOOTABLE IN Zero W (#952) due to libc6 or similar.e.g. if calibre-install-packages.sh isn't run above?
#  #command: scripts/calibre-install-latest-rpi-plus.sh    # WORKED for Calibre 3.27.1 on 2018-07-22 (#948 -> PR #950) THO NOT BOOTABLE IN Zero W (#952).  Similar to Calibre 3.24.x & 3.25 in June 2018, which had used calibre-install-packages.sh then Debian's own calibre-install-latest.sh
#  when: is_raspbian and internet_available

- name: Upgrade to latest Calibre using .deb's from testing (rpi)
  command: scripts/calibre-install-latest-rpi.sh # WORKED for Calibre 3.33.1 on 2018-10-23.  And Calibre 3.28 on 2018-07-26 (PR #971).  Likewise for Calibre 3.26.x.  FAILED with Calibre 3.24+ ("calibre : Depends: python-pyqt5 (>= 5.10.1+dfsg-2) but 5.10.1+dfsg-1+rpi1 is to be installed") since June 2018.
