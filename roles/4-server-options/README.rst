4-server-options README
=======================

Whereas 3-base-server installs critical packages needed by all, this 4th stage installs a broad array of *options* -- depending on which server apps will be installed in later stages -- as specified in /etc/iiab/local_vars.yml

This includes some networking fundamentals, before they're configured later on.

As in the case of 2-common, 3-base-server and 5-xo-services: this stage installs core server infra, that is not user-facing.
