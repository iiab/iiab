# 2025-03-31: WiFi firmware was crashing OFTEN in roles/network/tasks/NM-debian.yml
# so let's help everyone better monitor in future, on RPi or elsewhere.
# Extensive March 2025 testing summarized in roles/network/tasks/main.yml
# (just below NM-debian.yml) and at https://github.com/iiab/iiab/pull/3965
- name: Did WiFi firmware crash since boot? Try to record phyname in /sys/class/ieee80211/ to check below
  shell: ls /sys/class/ieee80211/ | head -1
  register: phyname

- name: Did WiFi firmware crash since boot? Run 'dmesg | grep "Firmware has halted or crashed"' to check
  shell: dmesg | grep "Firmware has halted or crashed"
  register: dmesg_fw_crash
  failed_when: false

    msg: "PLEASE CONSIDER: (1) adding 'brcmfmac.debug=0x100000' to /boot/firmware/cmdline.txt (and then reboot) to provide much more logging, (2) running 'sudo iiab-diagnostics'
      to submit a bug report, (3) reading https://github.com/iiab/iiab/pull/3965 to learn more."
