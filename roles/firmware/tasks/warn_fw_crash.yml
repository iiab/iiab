# 2025-03-31: WiFi firmware was crashing OFTEN in roles/network/tasks/NM-debian.yml
# so let's help everyone better monitor in future, on RPi or elsewhere.
# Extensive March 2025 testing summarized in roles/network/tasks/main.yml
# (just below NM-debian.yml) and at https://github.com/iiab/iiab/pull/3965


- name: Did WiFi firmware crash since boot? Try to record phyname in /sys/class/ieee80211/ to check below
  shell: ls /sys/class/ieee80211/ | head -1

- name: Did WiFi firmware crash since boot? Run 'dmesg | grep "Firmware has halted or crashed"' to check
  shell: dmesg | grep "Firmware has halted or crashed"
