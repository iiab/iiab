# Plz set 'rpi3bplus_rpi4_wifi_firmware' and 'rpizerow_rpi3_wifi_firmware' in
# /etc/iiab/local_vars.yml to increase (or modify) the number of student WiFi
# client devices that can access your Raspberry Pi's internal WiFi hotspot.

# If IIAB's already installed, you should then run 'cd /opt/iiab/iiab' and
# then 'sudo ./runrole firmware' (DO RUN iiab-check-firmware FOR MORE TIPS!)

# 2018-2023 Background & Progress:

# ► SEE "MONITOR FIRMWARE UPDATES in 3 places especially" in tasks/download.yml ◄

- name: Install firmware (for RPi internal WiFi)
  include_tasks: install.yml
  when:
    - firmware_installed is undefined
    - "'proot-distro' not in (ansible_kernel | default('') | lower)"


# Two variables are placed in /etc/iiab/iiab_state.yml:
#
# - firmware_downloaded (set in download.yml) is used in install.yml
#
# - firmware_installed (set in install.yml) isn't acted upon programmatically.
#   It serves as a very helpful rapid reminder in iiab_state.yml in the same
#   way as roles like: sshd, iiab-admin, pylibs, www_base, www_options.
