# Please set 'wifi_hotspot_capacity_rpi_fix: True' in /etc/iiab/local_vars.yml
# to restore support for 30-32 WiFi client devices on most Raspberry Pis that
# have internal WiFi.  This installs firmware 7.45.98.65 for Zero W and RPi 3
# and firmware 7.45.18.0 for RPi 3 B+ and RPi 4.  Capacity testing writeup:

- name: Install firmware (for RPi internal WiFi)
  include_tasks: install.yml
  #when: firmware_installed is undefined

# Two variable are placed in /etc/iiab/iiab_state.yml:
#
# - firmware_downloaded (set in download.yml) is used in install.yml
#
# - firmware_installed (set in install.yml) isn't acted upon programmatically.
#   It serves as a very helpful rapid reminder in iiab_state.yml in the same
#   way as roles like: sshd, iiab-admin, pylibs, www_base, www_options.
