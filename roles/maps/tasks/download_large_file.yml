# This is an attempt at a "smart" downloader of large files. It behaves the way
# I was hoping ansible's `get_url` would behave in the first place:
#
# * Download the file to a temp file
# * Get the sha256sum of the temp file
# * If the sha256sum is not what is expected, throw an error
# * Rename the temp file to the destination path
# * Save the sha256sum to a separate file (with extension .sha256)
#
# On subsequent runs, the usual behavior will be that it sees the saved
# sha256sum file, it matches the expected sha256sum, and it skips. (This is
# the logical equivalent of calculating the sha256sum on the actual downloaded
# file, but much faster for large files).
#
# However, if we need to update the sha256sum for whatever reason, it will see
# that the sha256sum does not match, and it runs the download process again.
#
# NOTE Already downloaded files show up as "skipped" instead of "ok".  I could
# fix this but we'll move to the download manager in due time anyway.
# TODO - files should be owned by www-data
