This directory is for building files/maps.black.js. It contains the following files from the maps.black repository in the `client/` directory:

* maps.black.js
* package.json
* package-lock.json

The initial versions of these files match the same files from the maps.black repository version `12205728ceb0672682381088c6c1e7ad05fdc4f5`, and the built version at files/maps.black.js perfectly matches what (as of Jan 2026) is being hosted at https://v1.maps.black/maps.black.js

However, over time we will add changes to maps.black.js to meet our needs, and files/maps.black.js should be rebuilt. Hopefully this will be rare.

If maps.black ever releases an update to maps.black.js, we should first overwrite our copy with the *unchanged* new version from maps.black's repository, and commit it. We should then confirm that the generated files/maps.black.js still matches what maps.black is serving (perhaps https://v2.maps.black/maps.black.js). After that, we should repeat the same custom changes we applied to the previous version, each as separate additional commits, so we can continue to keep track of them.

# Building

Warning: You may want to run this in a VM. It will install nodejs from nodesource, not your OS's repository. It will also install npm packages.

To build, copy this directory to your build environment, and run `./build.sh`. The built version of maps.black.js will be in the `client/` subdirectory. Rescue it from your build environment and overwrite `files/maps.black.js` in the iiab repository and commit it.
