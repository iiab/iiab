# "Emergency" reinstalls (from /opt/iiab/downloads/wordpress.tar.gz
# to /library/wordpress) should also work offline...
#
# ONLINE OR OFFLINE, IF YOU NEED A CLEAN REINSTALL OF WORDPRESS DURING YOUR
# NEXT RUN OF "./runrole wordpress" OR "./iiab-install" PLEASE FIRST DO:
#
# - "mv /library/wordpress /library/wordpress.old"
# - back up WordPress's database then drop it
#
# REASON: "keep_newer: yes" below tries to preserve WordPress's self-upgrades
# and security enhancements using timestamps under /library/wordpress, as these
# can arise without warning when WordPress is online, since WordPress ~4.8

  package:

      - libsodium23                      # Likewise installed in nginx/tasks/install.yml via php{{ php_version }}-fpm AND httpd/tasks/install.yml via libapache2-mod-php{{ php_version }} AND moodle/tasks/install.yml -- it can ALSO be auto-installed by phpX.Y-cgi OR phpX.Y-cli as confirmed by 'apt rdepends libsodium23' -- VERIFY USING 'php -i | grep sodium' AND 'apt list "*sodium*"'
      - php{{ php_version }}-bcmath      # OPTIONAL: Likewise installed in nextcloud/tasks/install.yml, pbx/tasks/freepbx_dependencies.yml
      #- php{{ php_version }}-common     # Auto-installed as an apt dependency.  REGARDLESS: php{{ php_version }}-common superset php{{ php_version }}-cli is auto-installed by php{{ php_version }}-fpm in nginx/tasks/install.yml

      - php-imagick                      # BUT drags in Apache's libapache2-mod-phpX.Y etc, as confirmed by 'apt depends php-imagick' -- while php{{ php_version }}-imagick installs (despite not being shown within 'apt list "php*imagick"') it's no better -- and 'apt depends phpX.Y-imagick' mysteriously does NOT show its deps.  Likewise installed in nextcloud/tasks/install.yml
