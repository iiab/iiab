portable.yml used to create a containter filesystem to hold the contents of /library gaining the abiltiy to export the entire data structure as one file living somewhere else on the filesystem.
library_loc: path to image, defaults to '{{ iiab_base }}'
library_img: name of the file holding the underling filesystem.
library_size: passed directly to dd use the shorthand such as 115g 10G 500M as the final size of the /library 'partition' 
You don' have to use all that is available, starting with 3G works with small installs with half still available for testing in a VM 10GB.
library_base_url: web location of pre-populated image file (can be with only admin-console pre-installed).
library_base_path: local location of pre-popuplated image file to expand.
