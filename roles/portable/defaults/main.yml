#portable.yml used to create a containter filesystem to hold the contents of /library gaining the abiltiy to export the entire data structure as one file living somewhere else in the filesystem.
#library_img: local name of the file holding the underling /library filesystem.
#library_size: passed directly to dd use the shorthand such as 115g 10G 500M to set the "final size" of the /library 'partition'.
#3G works with small install with half still available for testing. NOTE: when adding space to a library container remember it's the total size limit and should not exceed the underling host filesystem.

library_loc: "{{ iiab_base }}"
#library_img: iiab-testing
#library_size: 3G
#library_base_url: # web location of pre-populated raw base.img, maps.img etc...
#library_base_path: "{{ iiab_base }}" # local location of pre-populated image file to deploy

#produced base.img with the unittest file under 'iiab' with library_size set to 100M got luckly.
#produced maps.img from base.img with osm True and ./runroles portable osm-vector-maps with library_size set to 200M got luckly again.
#produced kalite.imge from maps.img with library_size set to 2000M
#library_loc was set to the VM's share directory at /output
