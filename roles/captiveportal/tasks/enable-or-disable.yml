# 2020-01-22: Package 'uwsgi' is installed by nginx/tasks/install.yml for
# Captive Portal (responds to browsers trying to detect a Captive Portal) and
# also for Admin Console.

# IIAB makes the 'uwsgi' service mandatory for now (see Line 45) but this could
# perhaps be auto-disabled in future (or never installed?)  e.g. if Captive
# Portal + Admin Console are both unneeded...and impact of uWSGI is too high ?
