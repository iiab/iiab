DokuWiki README
===============

DokuWiki is a simple to use and highly versatile Open Source wiki software that 
doesn't require a database. It is loved by users for its clean and readable
syntax. The ease of maintenance, backup and integration makes it an 
administrator's favorite. Built in access controls and authentication connectors
make DokuWiki especially useful in the enterprise context and the large number of
plugins contributed by its vibrant community allow for a broad range of use cases
beyond a traditional wiki.

After Installation
------------------

Head to http://box.lan/wiki. The webpage will probably throw up an error
saying you haven't run install.php yet, with a link to it. Click the link to be 
taken to the install page which does the initial configuration of the wiki. After
this, you should be all set!

Locations
---------

Everything is copied to the /opt/dokuwiki folder. An apache configuration file is
installed in the usual conf.d directory.

Parameters
----------
None yet other than the basic enabled/disabled. Haven't really tested if they work.

Todo
----
* Preinstall some popular plugins.
* Additional IIAB customizations.
