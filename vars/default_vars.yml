# How This Works:
#
# 1. /opt/iiab/iiab/iiab-install copies /opt/iiab/iiab/scripts/local_facts.fact
#    to /etc/ansible/facts.d/local_facts.fact
# 2. Ansible runs /etc/ansible/facts.d/local_facts.fact to identify the OS
# 3. The correct /opt/iiab/iiab/vars/<OS>.yml is then invoked by any the
#    following high-level scripts in /opt/iiab/iiab for IIAB operators:
#       ./iiab-install (uses iiab-stages.yml)
#       ./iiab-network (uses iiab-network.yml)
#       ./runrole (uses run-one-role.yml)
# 4. Likewise behind the scenes:
#       ./iiab-configure (uses iiab-from-cmdline.yml)
#       Admin Console (uses iiab-from-console.yml)
# 5. roles/0-init/tasks/main.yml reads from /etc/ansible/facts.d file(s)
#    local_facts.facts (but not admin_facts.fact ?)
# 6. /etc/iiab/iiab.env is created by roles/1-prep/templates/iiab.env.j2
