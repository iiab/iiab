# (Re)running collection installs appears safe, with --force-with-deps to force
# upgrade of collection and dependencies it pulls in.  Note Ansible may support
# upgrading all collections cleanly in future.  See PR #2652 (links) & PR #2653
#ansible-galaxy collection install --force-with-deps community.general
#ansible-galaxy collection install --force-with-deps community.mysql
#ansible-galaxy collection install --force-with-deps ansible.posix # For 3 below
# selinux WAS in /opt/iiab/iiab/roles/1-prep/tasks/main.yml
# sysctl in      /opt/iiab/iiab/roles/2-common/tasks/main.yml
