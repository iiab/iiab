# Internet-in-a-Box (IIAB)

Welcome to the GitHub repository for [Internet-in-a-Box (IIAB)](http://internet-in-a-box.org).  IIAB is a small and inexpensive device which provides essential Internet resources (Wikipedia, OpenStreetMap, Khan Academy and others) *usable even when offline!*

Create the digital library needed by your school, your medical clinic, your region and/or your very own family — accessible with any nearby smartphone, tablet or laptop.

Internet-in-a-Box provides you the tools to DIY (download and customize) a local content hotspot or server, using the Internet's crown jewels and the very best of the World’s Free Knowledge.

Schools can also choose among [30 powerful educational apps](http://wiki.laptop.org/go/IIAB/FAQ#What_services_.28IIAB_apps.29_are_suggested_during_installation.3F) for teachers and students, optionally with a complete LMS (learning management system).

FYI this community product is enabled by professional volunteers working [side-by-side](http://wiki.laptop.org/go/IIAB/FAQ#What_are_the_best_places_for_community_support.3F) with schools, clinics and libraries around the world.  *Thank you for being a part of our grassroots technology movement!*

## Installation

Install Internet-in-a-Box (IIAB) from http://download.iiab.io

Please see http://FAQ.IIAB.IO which has 40+ questions and answers to help you along the way, as you put together the <!--digital--> "learning hotspot" most suitable for your own community.

The [Installation](https://github.com/iiab/iiab/wiki/IIAB-Installation) wiki page has more intricate details e.g. if you're trying to install Internet-in-a-Box (IIAB) on a [different platform](https://github.com/iiab/iiab/wiki/IIAB-Platforms) that has not yet been tried.

Then you [add content](https://github.com/iiab/iiab/wiki/IIAB-Installation#add-content), which can of course take time when downloading multi-gigabyte Content Packs!

Finally, you can [customize your Internet-in-a-Box home page](http://wiki.laptop.org/go/IIAB/FAQ#How_do_I_customize_my_Internet-in-a-Box_home_page.3F) (typically http://box or http://box.lan) using our drag-and-drop Admin Console (http://box/admin) &mdash; to arrange Content Packs and IIAB Apps (services) for your local community's needs.

#### Built with Ansible

FYI we use [Ansible](http://wiki.laptop.org/go/IIAB/FAQ#What_is_Ansible_and_what_version_should_I_use.3F) as the underlying technology to install, deploy, configure and manage the various software components.
