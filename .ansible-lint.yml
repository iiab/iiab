# Ansible-lint is able to recognize and load skip rules stored inside
# `.ansible-lint-ignore` (or `.config/ansible-lint-ignore.txt`) files.
# To skip a rule just enter filename and tag, like "playbook.yml package-latest"
# on a new line.
# Optionally you can add comments after the tag, prefixed by "#". We discourage
# the use of skip_list below because that will hide violations from the output.
# When putting ignores inside the ignore file, they are marked as ignored, but
# still visible, making it easier to address later.

  - yaml[comments] # ignore comments without leading space

# Ansible-lint does not automatically load rules that have the 'opt-in' tag.
# You must enable opt-in rules by listing each rule 'id' below.
# enable_list:

# Report only a subset of tags and fully ignore any others

  # - role-name
  # - yaml[document-start]  # you can also use sub-rule matches

# Some rules can transform files to fix (or make it easier to fix) identified
# errors. `ansible-lint --fix` will reformat YAML files and run these transforms.
# By default it will run all transforms (effectively `write_list: ["all"]`).
# You can disable running transforms by setting `write_list: ["none"]`.
# Or only enable a subset of rule transforms by listing rules/tags here.
