install:
#  - scripts/ansible    # See #2105: fails to install latest Ansible (& ~4 Ansible Collections from collections.yml) due to Travis VM's disk layout/perms being different
#  - pip install ansible    # SLOW/OVERWEIGHT: installs Ansible 3.0.0+ with ~80 Ansible Collections
#  - pip install ansible-base    # ALSO WORKS (FASTER THAN ALL ABOVE!) e.g. if the above addons: / apt: section is commented out.  To install latest ansible-base e.g. 2.10.7+, similar to https://github.com/iiab/iiab/blob/master/scripts/ansible
#  - pip3 install ansible-core    # APRIL 2021: ansible-base is being renamed to ansible-core -- latest version number is listed at https://pypi.org/project/ansible-core/
  - ansible-galaxy collection install -r collections.yml    # Install ~4 Ansible Collections
  - "{ echo 'roles_path = ./roles/'; } >> ansible.cfg"    # Add correct roles_path to ansible.cfg, appending to https://github.com/iiab/iiab/blob/master/ansible.cfg
#  - "{ echo '[defaults]'; echo 'roles_path = ./roles/'; } >> ansible.cfg"    # 2021-02-24: suddenly no longer works, with the newer ansible-base install methods above (error arises due to '[defaults]' appearing twice)
#  - cat ansible.cfg    # UNCOMMENT TO VERIFY!
  - apt -a list ansible-base    # VERIFY ansible-base VERSIONS OFFERED BY apt
