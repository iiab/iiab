#      - python3-pip    # Modern equivalent (not nec here on Travis?)
#      - ansible-core    # SLOW.  WHEN IT WORKS AT ALL.  Using 'pip3 install ansible-core' instead (below) is faster and greatly simplifies.  Certainly let's try to mimic https://github.com/iiab/iiab/blob/master/scripts/ansible (as it evolves) for linting etc?
#      - python3-pymysql    # These 7-or-8 packages (below) are not needed during the very rapid --syntax-check (core script, at bottom)
#      - python3-psycopg2
#      - python3-passlib
#      - python3-pip
#      - python3-setuptools
      - python3-packaging    # To avoid warning "packaging Python module unavailable; unable to validate collection..."

#      - virtualenv

install:
#  - scripts/ansible    # See #2105: fails to install latest Ansible (& ~4 Ansible Collections from collections.yml) due to Travis VM's disk layout/perms being different
#  - pip3 install ansible    # SLOW / OVERWEIGHT: installs Ansible 4.0.0+ superset, with more than 80 (far more than we need) Ansible Collections
  - pip3 install ansible-core    # SIGNIFICANTLY FASTER than apt install of ansible-core (in 'packages:' section above).  APRIL 2021: ansible-base (2.10) was renamed to ansible-core (2.11+) with the latest version number shown at https://pypi.org/project/ansible-core/
  - ansible-galaxy collection install -r collections.yml    # Install ~4 Ansible Collections.  Slow but nec, as per https://github.com/iiab/iiab/blob/master/scripts/ansible
  - echo 'roles_path = ./roles/' >> ansible.cfg    # Add correct roles_path to ansible.cfg, appending to https://github.com/iiab/iiab/blob/master/ansible.cfg
#  - "{ echo '[defaults]'; echo 'roles_path = ./roles/'; } >> ansible.cfg"    # 2021-02-24: suddenly no longer works, with the newer ansible-base -> ansible-core install methods above (error arises due to '[defaults]' appearing twice)
  - cat ansible.cfg    # VISUAL VERIFICATION OF ABOVE!
#  - apt -a list ansible-core    # VERIFY ansible-core VERSIONS OFFERED BY apt, from https://launchpad.net/~ansible/+archive/ubuntu/ansible
